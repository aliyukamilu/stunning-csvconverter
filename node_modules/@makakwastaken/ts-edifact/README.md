## Credit

This repository is a fork of RovoMe's version of node-edifact:

- [ts-edifact](https://github.com/RovoMe/ts-edifact)

`ts-edifact` is an _Edifact_ parsing library written in typescript. This implementation was initially based on [node-edifact](https://github.com/tdecaluwe/node-edifact) but has changed a bit since the start of the project. It now is able to build a full object tree based on the general message structure defined in the Edifact documentation and update the tokenizer with the the appropriate charset, which was defined in the `UNB` segment.

By default `ts-edifact` ships with a selection of `D:01B` message structure definitions as well as their respective segment and element definition files. For convenience a parser was added recently to generate such definitions from the [UNECE](https://www.unece.org/) Web page. Plans to generate these definition files from the [Edifact Directory](https://www.unece.org/tradewelcome/un-centre-for-trade-facilitation-and-e-business-uncefact/outputs/standards/unedifact/directories/download.html) exist, though due to time limitations this feature wasn't added yet.

Currently supported functionality:

- An ES6 streaming parser reading UN/EDIFACT messages.
- Provide your own event listeners to get the parser to do something useful.
- Construct structured javascript objects from UN/EDIFACT messages.
- Support for the UNA header and custom separators.
- Validating data elements and components accepted by a given segment.
- Parsing and checking standard UN/EDIFACT messages with segment tables.
- Support for envelopes.
- Check for well-formed Edifact documents according to the defined message type, version and revision within the `UNH` message header.
- Generation of Edifact specification definition files (i.e. `D01B_INVOIC.struct.json` and `D01B_INVOIC.segments.json`) obtained from the UNECE page directly.
- On using the `Reader` class, updating the charset according to the one specified in the `UNB` segment of the interchange is supported.

## Current status

We switched from `ts-edifact` to a currently proprietary Java-based implementation I developed in the past year. During this process I learned a lot in regards to parsing Edifact files and, sadly, the current `ts-edifact` version has its limitations which briefly summarized look as such:

- The syntax version has no impact on the Edifact document. Neither charsets are correctly restricted or timestamps validated here correctly nor are service segments initialized here for the appropriate syntax version
- Charsets ([v3](https://www.gefeg.com/jswg/cl/v3/21a/cl1.htm), [v4](https://www.gefeg.com/jswg/cl/v4x/40219/cl1.htm)) in `UNB` segments are not correctly supported which can lead to issues for `UNOX` and `UNOY` encodings that may utilize up to 4 bytes per character
- Code-list values are not parsed and therefore not included in the validation process
- Objects generated for the object tree do not respect the specifications in different Edifact directories
- `segments.ts` and `elements.ts` only support basic
- Parsing and validation should be decoupled
- More configuration options are needed
- More sample files are needed, especially ones with uncommon charsets
- Better mechanism for loading message structure, segments and element definition tables needed to reduce the size of this artifact and to load definitions only when really needed. Any help from more experienced JS/TS developers is more than appreciated here on how such a mechanism may look like.

## Usage

This example parses a document and translates it to a javascript array `result` containing segments. Each segment is an object containing a `name` and an `elements` array. An element is an array of components.

```typescript
import { Parser, Validator, ResultType } from 'ts-edifact';

const enc: string = ...;
const doc: string = ...;

const parser: Parser = new Parser(new Configuration({ validator: new ValidatorImpl() }));

// Provide some segment and element definitions.
parser.configuration.validator.define(...);

// Parsed segments will be collected in the result array.
let result: ResultType = [];
let elements: string[][];
let components: string[];

parser.onOpenSegment = (segment: string): void => {
  // Started a new segment.
  elements = [];
  result.push({ name: segment, elements: elements });
});

parser.onElement = (): void => {
  // Parsed a new element.
  components = [];
  elements.push(components);
});

parser.onComponent = (value: string): void => {
  // Got a new component.
  components.push(value);
});

// by default the tokenizer of the parser will use UNOA charset
// if characters outside of those defined in the UNOA charset should be used
// the parser needs to be informed about which characters it should allow for alpha(numeric) values
parser.updateCharset("UNOC");
// send the Edifact data to the parser. This method supports streaming and can be invoked when new data
//  is available and it will continue from where it left
parser.write(doc);
// tell the parser that no more data is expected to be received
parser.end();
```

or more streamlined using the `Reader` utility class

```typescript
import { Reader, ResultType } from "ts-edifact";

const document: string = ...;
const specDir: string = ...;

const reader: Reader = new Reader(specDir);
const result: ResultType[] = reader.parse(document);
...
```

or if a custom set of segment- and element definitions should be used

```typescript
import { Reader, ResultType, Dictionary, SegmentEntry } from "ts-edifact";

import * as segmentsData from ".../segments.json";

const document: string = ...;
const specDir: string = ...;

const segments: Dictionary<SegmentEntry> = new Dictionary<SegmentEntry>(segmentsData);

const reader: Reader = new Reader(specDir);
reader.define(segments);
reader.define(elements);

const result: ResultType[] = reader.parse(document);
...
```

## Installation

The module can be installled through:

### NPM

```shell
npm install @makakwastaken/ts-edifact
```

### Yarn

```shell
yarn add @makakwastaken/ts-edifact
```

Keep in mind that this is an ES6 library. It currently can be used with node 4.0 or higher.

## Overview

This module is build around a central `Parser` class which provides the core UN/EDIFACT parsing functionality. It only exposes four methods:

- the `updateCharset(string)` method updates the charset used by the `Tokenizer` class to determine valid data values. If a charset is provided which the parser does not yet recognize, this method will throw an error.
- the `write()` method to write some data to the parser
- the `separators()`method does return the separators which are used by the parser
- the `end()` method to close an EDI interchange.

Data read by the parser can be read by using hooks which will be called on specific parsing events.

### Segment and element definitions

Definitions can be provided to describe the structure of segments and elements. An example of a segment definition:

```json
{
    "BGM": {
      "requires": 5,
      "elements": [
          {
              "id": "S001",
              "name": "syntaxIdentifier",
              "requires": 2,
              "components": [
                  { "format": "a4", "name": "syntaxIdentifier" },
                  { "format": "n1", "name": "syntaxVersionNumber" },
                  {
                      "format": "an..6",
                      "name": "serviceCodeListDirectoryVersionNumber"
                  },
                  { "format": "an..3", "name": "characterEncodingCoded" }
              ]
          }
      ]
}
```

A corresponding definition from the UN/EDIFACT `D01A` spec for the above mentioned `BGM` segment can be seen following [this link](http://www.unece.org/trade/untdid/d01a/trsd/trsdbgm.htm).

The `requires` property indicates the number of elements which are required to obtain a valid segment. The `elements` array contains the names of the elements which should be provided. Definitions can also be provided for these elements:

```json
{
  "C002": {
    "requires": 4,
    "components": ["an..3", "an..17", "an..3", "an..35"]
  },
  "C106": {
    "requires": 3,
    "components": ["an..35", "an..9", "an..6"]
  }
}
```

An incomplete set of D01B definition files can be found in the [`src/messageSpec`](src/messageSpec/) folder. The `*.struct.json` files contain the general structure definition of an Edifact message, i.e. `INVOIC.struct.json` contains the message structure specification of a `D01B` Edifact invoice, while `*.segments.json` contain the respective admissible segments of the acutal processed message type.

As of version `0.0.7` such definition files can be generated via the [`UNECEMessageStructureParser`](src/edi/messageStructureParser.ts) class in case the definition is available online at the [unece.org](https://www.unece.org) page. This parser will generate a `EdifactMessageSpecification` object structure that holds the actual message type structe definition as well as the segment- and element tables needed to validate the document to process.

The `persist` utility function of the `src/util` class allows to persist the generated definitions to files which can be used onwards.

```typescript
import { MessageStructureParser, UNECEMessageStructureParser } from "ts-edifact";
import { persist } from "ts-edifact/lib/util";

...

function storeSpecFiles(specDir: string, type: string, version: string, revision: string): Promise<...> {
    const structureParser: MessageStructureParser = new UNECEMessageStructureParser(version + revision, type);
    return loadTypeSpec()
      .then((response: EdifactMessageSpecification) => {
          // store downloaded and parsed definition files to the specified directory
          persist(response, specDir));

          ... // some other work
      }
      .catch((error: Error) => handle(error));
}

...
await storeSpecFiles("/home/SomeUser/edifact", "invoic", "d", "01b")
    .then(...);
```

On using the `Reader` class it will attempt to read such specification files from either the provided directory or, if none was provided, it will try to read such definition files from the local directory. The `*.segments.json` file are used during parsing time of the Edifact document to validate that only admissible values are provided for the respective segments/elements. By default, the `ValidatorImpl` class will ignore any unknown segments or element definitions found. If a strict validation should be performed, that throws an error in case an unknown segment or element is contained within the document the validator needs to be initialized with the optional `throwOnMissingDefinitions` parameter set to true.

```typescript
// use strict validation; will throw an error if unknown segments and elements are found
const validator: Validator = new ValidatorImpl(true)
```

The `*.struct.json` file is only used in case an object structure should be generated via the `InterchangeBuilder` class.

### Performance

Parsing speed including validation but without matching against a segment table is around 20Mbps. Around 30% of the time spent seems to be needed for the validation part.

If performance is critical the event callbacks can also be directly defined as methods on the `Parser` instance. Defining an event callback `onOpenSegment(callback)` then becomes:

```typescript
const parser: Parser = new Parser();
const callback = (segment: string) => { ... };

parser.onOpenSegment = callback;
```

Keep in mind that this avoids any `openSegment` events to be produced and as such, also it's associated overhead.

## Reference

<a name="Parser"></a>

### Parser

A parser capable of accepting data formatted as an UN/EDIFACT interchange. The constructor accepts a `Configuration` instance as an optional argument:

```typescript
new Parser();
new Parser(configuration: Configuration);
```

The first constructor will initialize a `NullValidator`, which does not perform any validation and therefore also not throw any errors.

<a name="Reader"></a>

### Reader

A convenience class which already implements default callbacks for common parsing tasks.

```typescript
new Reader(specDir?: string);
```

The optional `specDir` parameter should point to the location where the Edifact specification files can be found. If none was provided the reader tries to find them in the local directory.

| Function                                                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `define(definitions: (Dictionary<SegmentEntry> \| Dictionary<ElementEntry>)): void` | Feeds the validator used inside the reader with the set of known segment and element definitions. Parsed segments which do not adhere to the segments or elements defined in these tables will lead to a failure being thrown and therefore fail the parsing of the Edifact document.                                                                                                                                             |
| `parse(document: string): ResultType[]`                                             | Will attempt to parse the document to an array of segment objects where each segment object contains a name and a further multidimensional array of strings representing the elements in the outer array and the respective components of an element in the inner array. Any validation error encountered while reading the Edifact document will lead to an error being thrown and does ending the parsing process preemptively. |

Since `0.0.12` the `encoding(string)` function was removed as the charset is now set once the `UNB` header is processed. By default the parser will use the `UNOA` charset and update to the specified one once the respective charset was extracted.

<a name="Tracker"></a>

### Tracker

A utility class which validates segment order against a given message structure. The constructor accepts a segment table as its first argument:

```typescript
new Tracker(table: MessageType[]);
```

| Function                                       | Description                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `accept(segment: string \| MessageType): void` | Match a segment to the message structure and update the current position of the tracker. |
| `reset(): void`                                | Reset the tracker to the initial position of the current segment table.                  |

<a name="Validator"></a>

### Validator

The `Validator` can be used to validate segments, elements and components. It keeps track of element and component counts and checks if the component types match those in the segment definition.

```typescript
new ValidatorImpl(throwOnMissingDefinitions?: boolean = false);
```

Since `v0.0.7` a strict validation can be performed on setting the `throwOnMissingDefinitions` parameter to `true` which leads to failures if unknown segments or elements are used within the document under validation. Be default, the current implementation will ignore any unknown segments or elements.

| Function                                                                            | Description                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `disable(): void`                                                                   | Disable validation.                                                       |
| `enable(): void`                                                                    | Enable validation.                                                        |
| `define(definitions: (Dictionary<SegmentEntry> \| Dictionary<ElementEntry>)): void` | Provision the validator with an array of segment and element definitions. |
| `format(formatString: string): FormatType \| undefined`                             | Requests a component definition associated with a format string           |
| `onOpenSegment(segment: string): void`                                              | Start validation of a new segment                                         |
| `onElement(): void`                                                                 | Add an element                                                            |
| `onOpenComponent(buffer: Tokenizer): void`                                          | Open a component                                                          |
| `onCloseComponent(buffer: Tokenizer): void`                                         | Close a component                                                         |
| `onCloseSegment(segment: string): void`                                             | Finish the segment                                                        |

The `buffer` argument to both `onOpenComponent()` and `onCloseComponent()` should provide three methods `alpha()`, `alphanumeric()`, and `numeric()` allowing the mode of the buffer to be set. It should also expose a `length()` method to check the length of the data currently in the buffer.

<a name="InterchangeBuilder"></a>

### InterchangeBuilder

The `InterchangeBuilder` uses the result of the `Parser` or `Reader` to convert the array of segments into a JavaScript/TypeScript object structure representing the interchange envelop and the respective Edifact messages parsed.

It will attempt to use the specific message structure definition for the concrete version defined in the message header (`UNH`) to check whether a mandatory segment according to the Edifact specification is missing. A `D96A` invoice should therefore attempt to use the respective `D96A_INVOIC` message structure specification and if not obtainable fall back of a common `INVOIC` message struture specification.

The constructuro expects, besides the parsing result of the Edifact document a base path where the Edifact message structure definition files are located. An incomplete list can be found using the `./node_modules/ts-edifact/lib/messages/` base path.

```typescript
new InterchangeBuilder(parsingResult: ResultType[], basePath: string);
```

<a name="UNECEMessageStructureParser"></a>

### UNECEMessageStructureParser

_Since `v0.0.7`_: This class will parse the [unece.org](https://www.unece.org) Website in order to generate message structure definition as well as segment- and element definitions for a requested message type.

```typescript
new UNECEmessageStructureParser(version: string, type: string);
```

| Function                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `loadTypeSpec(): Promise<EdifactMessageSpecification>` | Downloads the message structure definition page of a respective Edifact message type, i.e. `INVOIC`, and for all specified segments the respective segment definition pages. These pages will be parsed and converted to a object structure supporting the lookup of the respective entries. |

The generated `EdifactMessageSpecification` object will hold the parsed values for the message type structure as well as the segments- and elements used by this message type.

Note that the respective segments and elements are mapped to own typescript objects which are defined in [src/edifact.ts](src/edifact.ts). The current set of classes is probably incomplete and may fall victim to differences between multiple versions and release tags of the Edifact specification. Consider further work to be done here in the future.

<a name="SegmentTableBuilder"></a>

### SegmentTableBuilder

A helper class to load the respective segment definition files, from either the local directory or a specified one, and convert them to a usable data structure needed by the validator and tracker classes.

```typescript
new SegmentTableBuilder(type: string);
```

| Function                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `forVersion(version: string): TableBuilder<SegmentEntry>`    | Sets the version of the Edifact document this builder should fetch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `specLocation(location: string): TableBuilder<SegmentEntry>` | Sets the path where to look for the segment definition files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `build(): Dictionary<SegmentEntry>`                          | Attempts to load the `*.segments.json` definition file of the specified message type (and version if specified) and returns a dictionary object with the loaded data. If no file could be found only the basic `UNB`, `UNH`, `UNS`, `UNT` and `UNZ` segment definitions are loaded. |
